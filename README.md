# PartyKit x React Native

## Package Exports

Metro complains about `import usePartySocket from "partysocket/react"` because of package exports which aren't fully compatible with react native as yet.

![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-09-12 at 11.31.14.png>)

We can resolve this with an unstable flag in the metro config as follows:

```js

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/configuration
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
const config = {
  resolver: {
    unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
  },
};
```

## Debug vs Release

PartySocket works perfectly in debug mode but not in Release mode, on both iOS as well as Android.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Run iOS in debug mode:

```bash
# run concurrently
yarn ios-party-debug 

# or run in separate terminals
yarn ios
yarn party
```

2. Verify that messages are coming into the app as well as the browser.

Open the partykit [dev page](http://127.0.0.1:1999/) and the ios app. You should see both sending/receiving messages:

3. Stop running processes.

4. Run iOS in release mode:

```bash
yarn ios-release
```

5. Open the app in release mode and the partykit [prod page](https://pkrepro.parasdaryanani.partykit.dev/).

6. Verify that connect/disconnect in the app works by closing the app (via Device > App Switcher) and reopening the app.

7. Notice that messages are not sent or received, although connect/disconnect seems ok.

8. Tailing partykit logs doesn't show anything suspicious.

9. Running the app in Release mode using XCode lets us tail logs in Release mode, which show the following errors:

I suspect that this has something to do with how events are implemented in react native, as well as the use of `MessageEvent` which is a DOM property, which is unavailable in react native.
10. I've written a hacky [patch](/patches/partysocket+0.0.8.patch) for this which seems to resolve the issue and enables partysocket to be used in Release mode. It's probably not the best way, but it lets us party on! ðŸŽˆ
